Instructions for Creating the Reference Guide

Create a concise, actionable reference guide following this structure:
Required Sections:

    Title and Purpose
        Clear title describing the task type
        1-2 sentence explanation of when to use this guide

    Overall Pattern/Structure
        High-level overview of the approach or pattern
        Visual representation if applicable (ASCII diagram, folder structure, etc.)
        2-3 sentences explaining the pattern

    Step-by-Step Instructions
        Break down the task into 3-6 clear steps
        Each step should have:
            Clear heading describing what to do
            Code example showing how to do it
            3-5 key rules or requirements for that step
        Use actual code, not placeholders

    Quick Checklist
        Bulleted markdown checklist summarizing all steps
        Use checkbox format: - [ ] Item
        Include critical validation or testing steps

Critical Requirements:

    Length: 50-200 lines MAXIMUM - Must be concise and scannable
    Code-heavy, explanation-light - Show more than tell
    No generic advice - Specific to this task type and codebase
    Real examples - Based on best practices from the provided resource
    Actionable - A developer should be able to follow it step-by-step

Process to Follow:

    Research the provided link thoroughly:
        Extract key patterns and best practices
        Identify common steps or structure
        Note specific conventions or anti-patterns
        Look for code examples to adapt

    Analyze my existing codebase (if applicable):
        Check if similar patterns already exist
        Identify naming conventions to match
        Find existing examples to reference
        Ensure consistency with global rules (CLAUDE.md)

    Create the guide following the structure above:
        Start with the overall pattern
        Break into clear, numbered steps
        Include code examples for each step
        End with a quick checklist

    Keep it focused:
        This guide is for ONE specific task type only
        Don't include general principles (those belong in CLAUDE.md)
        Don't duplicate information from global rules
        Focus on the step-by-step "how" not the "why"

Output Format:

Save the guide as reference/{task_type}_guide.md with:

    Clear section headers (## Step 1: ...)
    Code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
    Minimal explanatory text (let code speak)
    Practical checklist at the end

Example Task Types:

    Building API endpoints
    Creating React components
    Adding database models
    Writing integration tests
    Implementing authentication
    Creating CLI commands
    Building custom tools for agents
    Setting up background jobs

Start by researching the provided link now and analyzing the codebase for existing patterns. Then create the focused, actionable reference guide.
